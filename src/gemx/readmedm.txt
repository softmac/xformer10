As seen at the Macworld 98 Expo in January.  Emulators Inc. is proud to announce
the standalone release of Gemulator Exchange, the univeral disk access utility
for Windows 95 that reads Apple Macintosh and Atari ST disks and disk images.

Gemulator Exchange is ideal for Windows users who have the need to pull in
files from non-DOS disk formats.  Use it to access documents, spreadsheets,
pictures, and other cross-platform files on Macintosh and Atari disks.

Using a user interface similar to that of the Windows Explorer, you can now
access and navigate disks that were formerly unreadable by MS-DOS and Windows.

The PC's built-in floppy disk drive and CD-ROM are used to directly read files
from floppies and CDs.  With an optional SCSI adapter, ZIP disks and external
Macintosh hard disks can also be accessed directly.

Gemulator Exchange gives Windows 95 access to all of the following disk media:

    - Macintosh 1.44M floppy disks
    - Macintosh 400K and 800K 10-sector floppy disks (not GCR disks)
    - Macintosh CD-ROMs (including the Macintosh side of hybrid CDs)
    - Macintosh SCSI hard disks and Macintosh formatted Iomega ZIP disks
    - Macintosh disk images (.IMG, .IMAGE, and .DSK files)
    - Atari 8-bit disk images produced by SIO2PC (.ATR files)
    - Atari 8-bit disk images produced by PC Xformer (.XFD, .SS, and .DD files)
    - Atari ST hard disk images (.VHD files)
    - Atari ST 360K, 400K, 720K, 800K, and 1.44M floppy disks


Demo installation
-----------------

To install the Gemulator Exchange Demo, copy the file GEMEXCHD.EXE to your PC.
It is best to copy it directly to your Windows 95 desktop so that you can later
run it as easily as the Windows Explorer itself.

Double click the Gemulator Exchange Icon.  The left half of the window will
display all of the available DOS and non-DOS drives, starting with DOS drives,
then any SCSI devices such as CD-ROMs and ZIP disks, then any non-DOS floppies
and finally any installed disk images.

When browsing a disk, right click any file to display more information such as
the file size and file timestamp, or use the View Details menu options to do
the same for all files. Use the Backspace key to go up one directory level.

When browsing regular DOS drives, double clicking on any disk image file (.IMG,
.IMAGE, .DSK, .VHD, .ATR, .XFD, etc. file) will mount the disk image as a drive
and display it in the left window.  You can then navigate the contents of the
disk image itself.


Create disk image files!
------------------------

To create a disk image file from a floppy disk or SCSI device, select the disk,
then click the File \ Create Image From Disk menu.  You will be prompted to
provide the path and filename of the disk image file to create.

You can use this feature to create disk images of entire CD-ROMs and ZIP disks,
as well as any size floppy disk.  These disk images can then be used by our
Gemulator 98 product and other emulators.


Demo limitations
----------------

The demo has three features disabled:

    - you cannot drag and drop files to the Windows Explorer
    - you cannot use the Copy As Text feature
    - you cannot write out disk images to a real disk

You can purchase the complete Gemulator Exchange product directly from Emulators
Inc. at a special demo price of only $29.95 U.S. plus $3 shipping per order.

Commercial site licenses for Gemulator Exchange are available.


Run Macintosh software directly on the PC!
------------------------------------------

Our Gemulator 98 Standard Edition product (available separately) adds the full
capability of reading, writing, and executing software on non-DOS disks.  Use
it to run Mac OS and Macintosh programs, Atari GEM and Atari ST programs, and
even your favorite Atari 8-bit games on your Windows 95 or Windows NT computer.
