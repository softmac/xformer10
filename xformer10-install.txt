
XFORMER 10 is a simple drag-and-drop install requiring no special installer, drivers, or registry keys.

Simply drag the appropriate .EXE file to your Windows desktop (or other disk folder of your choice)
then double-click to launch XFORMER 10.  By default it will initialize and boot into Atari 800 BASIC.

Three versions of the XFORMER 10 binary are provided:

- XFORMER10.EXE is a universal 32-bit x86 build which runs on Windows 7 and later systems.
  Use this version if you do not know what kind of CPU is on your Windows device.

- XFORMER10-X64.EXE is a 64-bit build optimized for AMD and Intel based PCs running a 64-bit Windows.

- XFORMER10-ARM64.EXE is a 64-bit build for Windows 11 on ARM64 optimized for Qualcomm ARM64 based devices
  such as ASUS Nova Go, HP Envy X2, Lenovo Miix 630, Samsung Galaybook S, Surface Pro X, and others.

When launched simply select File \ Open Folder to load Atari 8-bit programs into the emulator.  Or even
simpler, merely drag-and-drop your Atari 8-bit binaries and disk images to the XFORMER 10 icon.  Simple!

As in previous XFORMER releases, an Atari DOS 2.5 floppy disk image is provided.  Clone this to create
additional Atari 8-bit virtual floppy disks for storing your Atari BASIC programs to.

To uninstall XFORMER10 simply delete the program icon from your desktop (or other installation folder).
